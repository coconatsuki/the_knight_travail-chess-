# the_knight_travail-chess-

This is a project from "The Odin Project" online bootcamp, "Data Structure Chapter".

Instructions can be found here : https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/data-structures-and-algorithms

This was an introduction, before creating a whole Chess game application as the Ruby Programming Chapter final project.
It was also meant to practice search algorithms.

The goal was :

Build a function knight_moves that shows the simplest possible way to get from one square to another
by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

The board would have 2-dimensional coordinates and the function would look like:

    knight_moves([0,0],[1,2]) == [[0,0],[1,2]]

    knight_moves([0,0],[3,3]) == [[0,0],[1,2],[3,3]]
